# Problem Statement:
### IOT BASED PERIMETER SECURITY 
# Existing System
The existing system consist of police officers involved in monitoring cctv and perimeter surveillance. The communication is done wireless and there are cases of communication gap.

# Proposed System
The proposed system is found to be a fully customisable,portable,low cost and a far more efficient system considering the coordination between the first
responders and accuracy of monitoring. The system is portable and because of that, it  is not to be hosted on a web platform instead is independent and confined to perimeter networks.

# Usage
- Security personnel can set up their own desired and complex perimeter with the hardware modules they have known as the Perimeter Pool.
- Which ever number of hardware modules being used can be configured with the control system.
- The control system is a web based application which can monitor and control the core functionalities of the system.
- Like said, any number of perimeter pools can be set up having a control system and a bunch of hardware modules.
- The communication remain secure as it doesnt go out of the private network.
- Multiple breach filtering mechanisms are used to eliminate redundant and false alarms.
- AI based object detection and recognition included for better accuracy and automation.
- Opens the door to computer based policing and requires only one officer to monitor the entire pool.

# Advantages
- Portable
- Automated
- Customisable
- Secure
- Efficient utilisation of resources
- Better coordination on the levels of security

# The Chakravyuh

A multilayered perimeter which can be setup using the hardware modules are known as chakravyuh. The perimeter pool can be set up inside/outside the government organisation and can be monitored by multiple private networks and control systems.
Can be termed as perimeter of perimeters.

# Example of usage

- A VIP is
